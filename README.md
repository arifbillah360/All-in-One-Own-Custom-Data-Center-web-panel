Abstract—This paper proposes a novel design for an “All-in-One Own Custom Data Center for Confidential Business,” a secure on-premises data center solution uniquely deployed at the business location. Our approach leverages a dedicated home server model, integrated with open-source secure web management, real-time analytics, and advanced threat detection (IPS/IDS). Although cloud-based and hybrid models have been widely studied, these approaches may expose sensitive data to third-party risks. This paper bridges the gap by combining insights from recent works on hybrid cloud security and confidential computing to develop a solution that maximizes data confidentiality and integrity. The proposed architecture prioritizes physical and logical security while addressing the trade-offs associated with cost and scalability.

I. Introduction
Data centers are critical to modern enterprises, yet the reliance on third-party cloud services introduces vulnerabilities in data confidentiality and control. Organizations handling highly sensitive information require infrastructure that minimizes exposure to external threats. In response, this paper presents an on-premises, custom data center model that is installed directly at the company’s premises. By integrating a dedicated home server with secure web management tools (e.g., CyberPanel), open-source monitoring solutions (e.g., NetData), and robust intrusion prevention/detection systems, the proposed system aims to provide enhanced security and full operational control. Although hybrid cloud models offer scalability, they inherently increase the risk of unauthorized access. In contrast, our solution, while less cost-effective and scalable, guarantees that data remains on-site, thereby significantly reducing potential exposure to external cyber threats.

II. Literature Review
Recent research has addressed various aspects of data center security and confidential computing. In “A Futuristic Approach to Security in Cloud Data Centers Using a Hybrid Model” (Eng. Proc. 2023), the authors present a hybrid architecture that merges on-premises controls with cloud services to achieve a high-security posture through physical access controls, multi-factor authentication, and robust surveillance. Although this work provides valuable insights into securing data centers, it emphasizes hybrid models where external cloud elements are still involved.
Conversely, “Confidential Computing: Extending Hardware-Enforced Cryptographic Protection to Data In Use” (Communications of the ACM, March 2021) focuses on leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs) and hardware-based encryption to protect data during processing. This paper underlines the benefits of confidential computing in cloud settings, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality even when processed in a potentially untrusted environment.
Despite these contributions, a research gap exists: both studies predominantly address hybrid or cloud-centric approaches. There is a paucity of research on dedicated on-premises solutions that are exclusively controlled by the business—an aspect critical for organizations that prioritize complete data sovereignty.

III. Research Objective
The primary objective of this work is to design, implement, and evaluate a secure, on-premises custom data center model for confidential business operations. Specifically, our research aims to:
Develop an architecture that integrates a dedicated home server with secure web management interfaces, real-time monitoring (e.g., NetData), and advanced security measures (IPS/IDS) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.
Evaluate the security performance of the proposed system in mitigating both physical and cyber threats, compared to hybrid and cloud-based alternatives.
Analyze the trade-offs between enhanced security and the limitations in scalability and hardware management inherent to on-premises solutions.
This study addresses the identified research gap by focusing exclusively on a business-controlled, on-premises data center, thus ensuring that all sensitive data remains within the organizational boundaries and is subject to direct oversight.



Challenges & Considerations
Hardware Maintenance: Since the server is physically located on-site, businesses need to take responsibility for maintenance and potential hardware upgrades.
Not Focused on Cost Efficiency: Unlike cloud-based alternatives that prioritize affordability, our solution is designed for security-first businesses.
Scalability Limitations: Expanding storage or computing power requires hardware upgrades, making it less flexible compared to cloud services.
Why Our Solution Stands Out
Maximum Security: Data never leaves the business premises, eliminating external risks.
Complete Control: Businesses have full authority over their own infrastructure with no dependency on third-party providers.
One-of-a-Kind Offering: Our home server model is unique, unlike competitors who rely on off-site data centers.
Regulatory Compliance & Confidentiality: Ideal for businesses that require strict adherence to data protection regulations and privacy laws.
